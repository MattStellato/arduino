The code directory is where the code lives.

The Arduino directory has the Arduino code
SmartPhone directory has smart phone code

Staging is where libraries are saved.  They are saved here as a convenience
for the various libraries required by the features we use.

Testcode is for hacking and, well, testing.

Program structure:

under Arduino/gbg is the main Arduino code set.
  The way I like to develop is with an external editor and breaking
	the code into modules.  The ino is required for the IDE to be used.
	the cpp code is actually where most of the working code, in modules,
	is.  Thus the bluetooth code is in it's own module and writing code
	for control doesn't mess with that.
